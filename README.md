# bank-checks
When a bank- or lottery check is printed, the amount is usually printed with both numbers and letters. Here I've written the algorithm that converts an amount to the alphabetical representation.

### To run the program you need to install all packages:
  ``` npm install  ```
### Then you need to run: 
   ``` npm run start ```
### To run the tests: 
   ``` npm run test ```
 ### To check the tests coverage:   
   ``` npm run test:coverage  ```
### To test the program
Open the terminal and use the function like down below: 
```js
converter(2); // two
converter(22); // twenty two
converter(222); // two hundred twenty two
converter(2222); // tho thousand two hundred twenty two
```
